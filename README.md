Sample OpenStack Dashboard for Horizon

Plug and play in the openstack_dashboard directory.

Restart Apache2 and you're in business.

It's just that simple.

Make changes to these files per your own specific needs.

Instances of "DashboardName" (upper or lower case) should be replaced with your own Dashboard Name, no pun intended.
